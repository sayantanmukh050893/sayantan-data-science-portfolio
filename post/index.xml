      <description>The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails.
Humans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart.
The purpose of this project is to detect whether or not a patient has healthy heart.</description>
