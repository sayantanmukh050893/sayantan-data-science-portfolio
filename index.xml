      <description>This project is a classic example of the Optical Character Recognition capabilities of the pytesseract python module with the help of which we can scan Indian PAN (Permanent Account Number) card and West Bengal Government Voter ID card.
This scanning mechanism can be useful to scan standard documents which would be trained before hand. As of now only PAN card and Voter ID cards have been trained so those two cards can be scanned and important features can be extracted.</description>

      <description>This project is a classic example of the Face Recognition capabilities of Computer Vision and Deep Learning with the help of which we would be creating a face recognizer for Lionel Messi.
In many big games critics find Messi to be subdued and missing from the game. This recognizer would end that debate once in for all as it would be able to identify Messi in images as well as in videos.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€‘19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 23 August 2020, more than 23.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 802,000 deaths. More than 14.8 million people have recovered.
The sole purpose of this project is to track the spread and development of this virus worldwide.</description>

      <description>The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails.
Humans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart.
The purpose of this project is to detect whether or not a patient has healthy heart.</description>
